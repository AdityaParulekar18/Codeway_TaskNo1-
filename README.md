Number Guessing Game:  
This Java program implements a classic Number Guessing Game
1. Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. User Interaction: It prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Guess Feedback: The user's guess is compared with the generated number, providing feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. The program keeps track of the user's score, which is incremented for each correct guess.
